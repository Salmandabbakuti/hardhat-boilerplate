# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node # starts local node
npx hardhat accounts # list accounts
npx hardhat balance --account '0x47a9...' # show balance eth of specified account
npx hardhat compile # compiles contracts
npx hardhat deploy # deploys contract defined in tasks
node scripts/deployContract.js
npx hardhat run --network local scripts/deployContract.js # deplys contract on specified network
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat help
```
